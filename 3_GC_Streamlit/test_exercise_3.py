"""
This module contains tests for the process_fasta_from_file function from the file_upload module.
It uses Python's unittest framework for setting up and running the tests, and unittest.mock for 
mocking dependencies.

The TestProcessFasta class encapsulates all unit tests for testing the error handling capabilities
of the process_fasta_from_file function when faced with problematic inputs.

    A test suite for testing the error handling of the process_fasta_from_file function.

    This class contains tests that verify if appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms 
    are triggered when an exception is encountered during file processing. Mock objects and patches 
    are used to simulate file reading errors and to ensure that error handling functions are called 
    appropriately.

        Test the behavior of process_fasta_from_file when it encounters an error while reading a 
        file.

        This method uses a mock object to simulate an exception being raised during the reading 
        of a file.
        It verifies that the handle_errors function is called as expected when such an exception 
        occurs, and it checks the function's output to ensure it returns an empty list, as expected 
        under error conditions.

            its call.

            Asserts that handle_errors is called once.
            Asserts that the result of process_fasta_from_file is an empty list.
